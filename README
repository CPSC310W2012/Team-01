All of your userstories should have more than one acceptance criteria. 

Title your userstory and task as follows (please)
Userstory 4 consistent UI
Task 4.1 Integrate backend components
Task 4.2 General UI
etc..
This will allow me to better comment and look through your tasks relating to a user story.
If you can create a milestone for each user story and then put tasks for userstories in the milestone.

Please put assignment 5 into your repository as a zip file.
Sincerely,
C. Albert Thompson
(the TA that is grading you)
